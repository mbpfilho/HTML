            Englander, Earl Hurd, Dick Rickard, Ted Sears and Webb Smith. David Hand was the supervising director, while

        <h3>Pinocchio</h3>
        <p>Pinocchio is a 1940 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and based on
            the 1883 Italian children's novel The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi. It was the second animated
            feature film produced by Disney, made after the first animated success Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
            (1937).</p>
        <p>The plot involves an old Italian woodcarver named Geppetto who carves a wooden puppet named Pinocchio. The
            puppet is brought to life by a blue fairy, who informs him that he can become a real boy if he proves
            himself to be "brave, truthful, and unselfish". Pinocchio's efforts to become a real boy involve encounters
            with a host of unsavory characters. The key character of Jiminy Cricket is based on a 100-year "wise, old"
            talking cricket from the original book, who warns Pinocchio of his impudence when they meet only to be
            killed in return shortly after, before returning as a ghost. The film was adapted by several storyboard
            artists from Collodi's book. The production was supervised by Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske, and the
            film's sequences were directed by Norman Ferguson, T. Hee, Wilfred Jackson, Jack Kinney, and Bill Roberts.
            Pinocchio was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to
            vehicles, machinery and natural elements such as rain, lightning, smoke, shadows and water. The film was
            released to theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on February 7, 1940.</p>
