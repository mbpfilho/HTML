        <h2>Persian cat</h2>
        <p>The Persian cat (گربه ایرانی, Gârbhe Irani) is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and
            short muzzle. It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in the English-speaking countries. The first
            documented ancestors of the Persian were imported into Italy from Persia around 1620. Recognized by the cat
            fancy since the late 19th century, it was developed first by the English, and then mainly by American
            breeders after the Second World War. Some cat fancier organizations' breed standards subsume the Himalayan
            and Exotic Shorthair as variants of this breed, while others treat them as separate breeds.</p>
        <p>The selective breeding carried out by breeders has allowed the development of a wide variety of coat colors,
            but has also led to the creation of increasingly flat-faced Persians. Favored by fanciers, this head
            structure can bring with it a number of health problems. As is the case with the Siamese breed, there have
            been efforts by some breeders to preserve the older type of cat, the traditional breed, having a more
            pronounced muzzle, which is more popular with the general public. Hereditary polycystic kidney disease is
            prevalent in the breed, affecting almost half the population in some countries.</p>
        <p>In 2021, it was ranked as the fourth most popular cat breed in the world according to the Cat Fanciers' The
            second was the Exotic breed.</p>
        <p>Bell goes on to detail the differences. Persian coats consist of a woolly under coat and a long, hairy outer
            coat. The coat loses all the thick underwool in the summer, and only the long hair remains. Hair on the
            shoulders and upper part of the hind legs is somewhat shorter. Conversely, the Angora has a very different
            coat which consists of long, soft hair, hanging in locks, "inclining to a slight curl or wave on the under
            parts of the body." The Angora's hair is much longer on the shoulders and hind legs than the Persian, which
            Bell considered a great improvement. However, Bell says the Angora "fails to the Persian in head," Angoras
            having a more wedge-shaped head and Persians having a rounder head.</p>
        <p>Bell notes that Angoras and Persians have been crossbred, resulting in a decided improvement to each breed,
            but claimed the long-haired cat of 1909 had significantly more Persian influence than Angora.</p>

        <h2 id="about-corgi">Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h2>
        <p>At 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder and 27 to 30 pounds, a well-built male Pembroke presents a big dog in a
            small package. Short but powerful legs, muscular thighs, and a deep chest equip him for a hard day’s work.
            Built long and low, Pembrokes are surprisingly quick and agile. They can be red, sable, fawn, and black and
            tan, with or without white markings.</p>
        <p>The Pembroke is a bright, sensitive dog who enjoys play with his human family and responds well to training.
            As herders bred to move cattle, they are fearless and independent. They are vigilant watchdogs, with acute
            senses and a “big dog” bark. Families who can meet their bold but kindly Pembroke’s need for activity and
            togetherness will never have a more loyal, loving pet.</p>
        <p>In medieval times, the kings of Europe advertised their majesty to their subjects and visiting emissaries by
            the richness of their possessions. Carpets, textiles, and tapestries were important factors in these
            displays of conspicuous consumption.</p>
        <p>The era’s best weavers were centered in Flanders, now northern Belgium. It was common for monarchs to stage
            talent raids to induce Flemish weavers to relocate to their kingdoms. So it was that in the year 1107, Henry
            I of Britain invited a community of these master craftsmen to live and work in southwestern Wales. The
            weavers accepted Henry’s invitation and brought all they needed to re-create their agrarian way of life in
            their new homeland. This included the dogs they bred to herd cattle and sheep. These sturdy, short-legged
            herders were the foundation for the breed we now know as the Pembroke Welsh Corgi.</p>

    Beers are not the same as bears. However, bears might like beers. We’re not too sure how beers feel about bears, though.
